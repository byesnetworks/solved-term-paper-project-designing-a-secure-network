This term paper involves putting together the various concepts learned throughout this course. You are tasked with designing the most secure network possible, keeping in mind your goal of supporting three (3) IT services: email, file transfer (centralized), and VPN. Your first step is to design a single network capable of supporting there three (3) different services. Once you have fully designed your network, you will need to provide three (3) workflow diagrams explaining how your designed network handles the three (3) different transactions. The first is an internal user sending an email using his / her corporate email address to a user on the Yahoo domain with an arbitrary address of <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bacfc9dfc88f898efac3dbd2d5d594d9d5d794">[email protected]</a> The second workflow diagram should show a user initiating an FTP session from inside your network to the arbitrary site of ftp.netneering.com. The third workflow is an externally located employee initiating a VPN session to corporate in order to access files on the Windows desktop computer, DT-Corp534-HellenS, at work.

Write a ten to fifteen (10-15) page paper in which you complete the following three (3) Parts. Note: Please use the following page breakdown to complete your assignment:

<ul>

 <li>Overall network diagram: One (1) page</li>

 <li>Datapath diagrams: Three (3) pages (one for each diagram)</li>

 <li>Write-up: six to ten (6-10) pages</li>

</ul>

Part 1

<ul>

 <li>Using Microsoft Visio or its open source alternative, create a diagram showing the overall network you’ve designed from the user or endpoint device to the Internet cloud, and everything in between, in which you:

  <ul>

   <li>Follow the access, core, distribution layer model.</li>

   <li>Include at a minimum:

    <ul>

     <li>Authentication server (i.e. Microsoft Active Directory)</li>

     <li>Routers</li>

     <li>Switches (and / or hubs)</li>

     <li>Local users</li>

     <li>Remote users</li>

     <li>Workstations</li>

     <li>Files share (i.e. CIFS)</li>

     <li>Mail server</li>

     <li>Web servers (both internal and external)</li>

     <li>Firewalls</li>

     <li>Internet cloud</li>

     <li>Web proxy</li>

     <li>Email proxy</li>

     <li>FTP server (for internal-to-external transport)</li>

    </ul></li>

   <li>Explain each network device’s function and your specific configuration of each networking device.</li>

   <li>Design and label the bandwidth availability or capacity for each wired connection.</li>

  </ul></li>

</ul>

Part 2

<ul>

 <li>Using Microsoft Visio or its open source alternative, create a Datapath Diagram for the following scenario:

  <ul>

   <li>Local user sends email to a Yahoo recipient. Local (corporate) user having email address <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#563c3938382f783e3f3a3a16153924266365627835393b"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c5adaca9a98586aab7b5f0f6f1eba6aaa8">[email protected]</span></a>sends an email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="582d2b3d2a6d6b6c182139303737763b373576">[email protected]</a>

    <ul>

     <li>Document and label the diagram showing protocols and path of the data flow as data traverses through your network from source to destination.</li>

     <li>Include path lines with arrows showing directions and layer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (OSI) protocols that are used for each flow.</li>

     <li>Show user authentication when necessary.</li>

    </ul></li>

   <li>Using Microsoft Visio or its open source alternative, create a Datapath Diagram for the following scenario:

    <ul>

     <li>Local user, Jonny Hill, transfers file using ftp through the Internet to another company’s site (<a href="ftp://ftp.netneering.com/">netneering.com</a>). He has to access the secure shell using his active directory credentials to authenticate to the ftp server (linux running Redhat) on the DMZ. He needs to transfer files from his desktop across the Internet to <a href="ftp://ftp.netneering.com/">ftp.netneering.com</a>.

      <ul>

       <li>Document and label the diagram showing protocols and path of the data flow as data traverses through your network from source to destination.</li>

       <li>Include path lines with arrows showing directions and layer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (OSI) protocols that are used for each flow.</li>

       <li>Show user authentication when necessary.</li>

      </ul></li>

     <li>Using Microsoft Visio or its open source alternative, create a Datapath Diagram for the following scenario:

      <ul>

       <li>Remote user, Hellen Stover, connects via VPN from home through the Internet to her corporate desktop, DT-Corp534-HellenS. Hellen uses a browser to initiate her VPN connection. By browsing to <a href="https://vpnaccess.corp534.com/">https://VPNaccess.corp534.com</a>, she arrives at a login page where she needs to authenticate using her Active Directory credentials before the VPN tunnel is built.</li>

      </ul></li>

     <li>Document and label the diagram showing protocols and path of the data flow as data traverses through your network from source to destination.</li>

     <li>Include path lines with arrows showing directions and layer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (OSI) protocols that are used for each flow.</li>

     <li>Show user authentication when necessary.</li>

     <li>Explain how your overall design protects the organization from both inside and outside attacks. Give examples.</li>

     <li>Explain how your layered design compensates for possible device failures or breaches in network security.</li>

     <li>Determine whether any possible bottlenecks exist in your design.</li>

     <li>Explain how to make the file transfer process more secure.</li>

    </ul></li>

  </ul></li>

</ul>

Part 3

<ul>

 <li>Use at least three (3) quality resources in this assignment. Note: Wikipedia and similar Websites do not qualify as quality resources.</li>
